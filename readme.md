# Wikipedia Scraper
Simple Wikipedia scraper that I made as a part of a internship application. The scraper takes a Wikipedia link and for each section, prints out the title, prints out the most frequent words that are not considered "stop words", and lists every hyperlink.


# Technologies
- Python 3
- Wikipedia API

**Python Libraries**
- BeautifulSoup4
- matplotlib
- nltk
- wordcloud


# Usage
## combined
The jupyter notebook this folder is entirely self contained. It should automatically download the required libraries to run.

## separated
There are two files in this folder. One that contains all the actual functionality and a jupyter notebook that makes it easier to view the visualizations. Install the required packages with the requirements.txt in the root dir.
